# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      <p>The concept of the Routes du Bonheur developed in parallel with that of Relais & Châteaux. Essentially these are travel routes that celebrate the ancient <em>art of hospitality</em> and la joie de vivre. The very first of these routes linked the eight founding hotels in France providing a unique itinerary far from the beaten tracks of a bland and standardised world.</p>
      <p>The uniquely African Routes du Bonheur depicted on this website represent popular and recommended tours that showcase the best travel experiences in Africa. But these tours are merely examples of what is possible. Our passionate team of travel planners are experts in crafting bespoke tours to suit your discerning requirements.</p>
      <p>Now is your chance to explore Africa, to savour its many delights and to craft your own tailor-made tour.</p>
